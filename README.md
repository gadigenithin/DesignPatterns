# Java Design Patterns

## Overview

This project showcases Java implementations of common design patterns, organized into three categories: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**. Each pattern is implemented in its own package, making it easy to explore and understand.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

src/
├── creational/
├── structural/
└── behavioral/


Each folder contains sub-packages for individual design patterns.

### Creational Patterns
1. **Singleton**: Ensures a single instance of a class.
2. **Factory Method**: Creates objects through a common interface.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects.
4. **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
5. **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing one.
6. **Object Pool**: Recycles expensive-to-create objects.

### Structural Patterns
1. **Adapter**: Converts incompatible interfaces.
2. **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation.
3. **Composite**: Combines objects into tree structures.
4. **Decorator**: Adds functionality to objects dynamically.
5. **Facade**: Simplifies complex systems.
6. **Flyweight**: Shares objects to save memory.
7. **Proxy**: Controls access to objects.

### Behavioral Patterns
1. **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests through a chain of handlers.
2. **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
3. **Iterator**: Allows sequential access to collection elements.
4. **Mediator**: Manages communication between objects.
5. **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's state.
6. **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects of state changes.
7. **State**: Changes an object's behavior based on its state.
8. **Strategy**: Makes algorithms interchangeable.
9. **Template Method**: Defines the structure of an algorithm.
10. **Visitor**: Adds operations to objects without modifying them.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gadigenithin/DesignPatterns.git

2. Explore the patterns in the **src folder.

3. To test a pattern, navigate to its sub-package and run the main class.
